Hi! My name is Joshua Isaacson.
I obtained my Ph.D. from Michigan State University in 2017 with my [thesis](https://d.lib.msu.edu/etd/6889) on the ResBos2 program.
After obtaining my Ph.D. I went to Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in the fall of 2017 as a Research Associate.
During this time, we obtained a SciDAC5 grant for development of Neutrino and Collider computational tools ([NeuCol](https://neucol.github.io/)).
Currently, I am an Applications Physicist I at Fermilab.

My main research focuses on the development of theoretical-computational tools for both the LHC and neutrino experiments. My main projects include the [Achilles](https://github.com/AchillesGen/Achilles) neutrino event generator, [ResBos2](https://resbos2.gitlab.io/), the [Sherpa](https://sherpa-team.gitlab.io/) collider event generator, and [Pepper](https://spice-mc.gitlab.io/pepper/intro.html) (the first ever platform-agnostic event generator).

I am also interested in developing machine learning tools to improve the performance of these tools and to address anomaly detection. This is mainly handled through the use of Normalizing Flows.

For additional details on my research, please see my [publications](/publications).
